Creating & mosaicking data cubes
********************************

* Each stack of reduced fibre spectra is resampled onto a 3D x-y-Î» grid (with
  reference to the MDF extension) using ``gfcube``:

  .. code-block:: none

    gfcube csteqbpxprgS20140919S0059 fl_atm+ fl_flux+ fl_var+ fl_dq+
    gfcube csteqbpxprgS20140919S0062 fl_atm+ fl_flux+ fl_var+ fl_dq+

  You should normally enable all of the options. The atmospheric dispersion
  correction automatically straightens the spectra to about 0.1" or better.

* To inspect the cubes, you can give any IRAF task a 1D or 2D image section,
  eg. to see a single image plane:

  .. code-block:: none

    display dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0059[sci][*,*,650] 1

  There are also various programs around that can display projections of a 3D
  cube directly, or you can load one from the DS9 GUI and step through the
  planes.

* Attempt to measure any spatial offsets between the cubes and shift their
  World co-ordinate systems to reflect those differences (so that features will
  have the same World co-ordinates in each one). Such offsets can be due to
  intentional dithering, flexure or re-acquisition on different
  nights. Any spectral offsets should already have been dealt with during
  :ref:`wavecal` or :ref:`flexure`.

  In this particular example, there is no significant difference between
  the exposures and the following step actually makes things slightly worse for
  some reason, so can be left commented out:

  .. code-block:: none

    # pyfalign dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0059,dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0062

  For nebulous sources, you should specify ``method=correlate``. If the
  registration doesn't work reliably, you can use any available method (eg.
  ``imexam``) to determine pixel offsets, multiply them by the pixel scale
  (usually 0.1) and subtract them from the header keywords CRVAL1 & CRVAL2.

* Resample all the cubes onto the same spatial grid and co-add them:

  .. code-block:: none

    pyfmosaic dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0059,dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0062 dcsteqbpxprgS20140919S0059_add var+

  To check the alignment, you can run this command with the ``separate+``
  option, which resamples the cubes onto the same grid but in separate FITS
  extensions, instead of co-adding them (this can also be used to align them
  prior to more sophisticated co-addition with another program, such as
  ``imcombine``).
